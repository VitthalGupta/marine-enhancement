# Enhancing Marine Surveliance with Machine Learning

## Introduction

Accurate identification of fishing boats is vital to ensure safe maritime activities. Research methods for the classification of boat types mostly use traditional radar recognition and optical recognition, but these methods all have their limitations. However, in the case of fishing boat identification based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, not only is it less affected by the weather, but also static information and dynamic information can be utilized. This thesis presents a comprehensive performance analysis of different classification models, including Random Forest (RF), J48 Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The models were evaluated using various metrics such as Accuracy, Average Precision, Average Recall, and Average F1 score. The results obtained from the analysis indicate that RF outperformed the other models in terms of all evaluation metrics, achieving an Accuracy of 84.05%, the highest among the models considered. RF also demonstrated the highest Average Precision and Average Recall of 84.2% and 84.1% respectively, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate classification and identification of positive instances. J48 Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Tree performed slightly lower in terms of Accuracy and other metrics.
This analysis highlights the effectiveness of Random Forest as the top-performing model, supporting its suitability for accurate classification and prediction in the given context. The ensemble of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM further strengthens the predictive capabilities, leading to an improved overall accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights for decision-making in similar classification tasks.
